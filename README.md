# 🚀 About

**RypeBot** is the automation engine behind **The RypeNation Discord Community**.

It is built to create, deploy, maintain, and expand large-scale Discord communities using modular deployment packages instead of manually creating hundreds of channels and permissions.

Rather than acting like a traditional moderation bot, RypeBot serves as the operating system for Discord infrastructure.

## Gaming Integrations

RypeBot includes a modular gaming service layer at `src/services/gaming` so individual games can share reusable API clients while keeping game-specific behavior separate.

Current integration:

- League of Legends

League slash commands:

- `/lol-item item` looks up League item details from Riot Data Dragon and returns source links.
- `/lol-player player tagline region` resolves a Riot ID through Account-V1, then builds a multi-embed player report from Summoner-V4, League-V4, Champion-Mastery-V4, Match-V5, and live game status when available.

League item provider architecture:

- Data Dragon is the source of truth for item name, description, gold, stats, build paths, tags, maps, and icon.
- Community Dragon is optional enrichment for raw data and asset links.
- League Wiki and Fandom links are generated from the normalized item name for convenience.
- Wiki providers do not scrape page content, and `/lol-item` does not depend on unofficial sources.
- Providers are independent so future integrations can add sources such as Lolalytics, OP.GG, U.GG, or other game-specific providers.

League player examples:

- `/lol-player player: SomeName#NA1 region: na1`
- `/lol-player player: Some Name#1234 region: na1`
- `/lol-player player: SomeName tagline: NA1 region: na1`
- `/lol-player player: SomeName` uses `LOL_DEFAULT_REGION` and `LOL_DEFAULT_TAGLINE` when configured.

Riot IDs require both the game name and tagline because names are not globally unique. Name-only player input tries the configured default tagline when present, then asks for the exact Riot ID if Riot cannot find a match.

Supported League platform regions:

- Americas route: `na1`, `br1`, `la1`, `la2`
- Europe route: `euw1`, `eun1`, `tr1`, `ru`
- Asia route: `kr`, `jp1`
- SEA route: `oc1`, `ph2`, `sg2`, `th2`, `tw2`, `vn2`

League player lookup requires `RIOT_API_KEY` in the local `.env`. Optional defaults are `LOL_DEFAULT_REGION`, `LOL_DEFAULT_REGIONAL_ROUTING`, and `LOL_DEFAULT_TAGLINE`. Keep real Riot keys out of commits and only document variables in `.env.example`.

# Infrastructure v1.0

RypeBot can answer the operational question: "Does Discord currently match GitHub/project config?"

Use these commands from PowerShell at the project root.

```powershell
npm run audit
npm run repair -- --dry-run
npm run repair
npm run rollback -- --dry-run
npm run rollback
npm run deploy:everything -- --dry-run
npm run deploy:everything
```

## Command Guide

`npm run audit`

Read-only. Compares the expected project configuration against the live Discord server. Reports matching items, missing roles/categories/channels, extra live objects, permission drift, warnings, and the recommended next command.

`npm run repair -- --dry-run`

Safe preview. Shows missing structure and permission changes that would be applied. Does not modify Discord.

`npm run repair`

Creates missing configured roles/categories/channels and applies role plus channel/category permission drift fixes. It writes a backup first and does not delete extra live Discord objects.

`npm run rollback -- --dry-run`

Safe preview. Finds the most recent `backups/permissions-backup-*.json` file and shows the role/channel permission state it would restore.

`npm run rollback`

Restores permissions from the most recent permission backup. It fails safely if no backup exists and does not guess missing live Discord objects.

`npm run deploy:everything -- --dry-run`

Runs the full pipeline in preview mode. It stops on the first failed safety check.

`npm run deploy:everything`

Runs the safe deployment pipeline in order: backup current live Discord state, deploy roles/categories/channels, deploy role permissions, deploy channel/category permissions, then prompts you to run `npm run audit`.

Extra live Discord objects are reported but not deleted. Deletion is intentionally not part of Infrastructure v1.0 unless a future command implements an explicit, reviewed `--delete-extra` workflow.
